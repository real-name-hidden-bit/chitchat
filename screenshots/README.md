## Tips for Good Screenshots

2. **Use consistent zoom level** - 100% zoom recommended
3. **Include enough context** - Make sure relevant UI elements are visible
4. **Crop appropriately** - Remove unnecessary whitespace
5. **Use realistic data** - Create a few test accounts and tweets for better screenshots
6. **File format** - Save as PNG for better quality
7. **Resolution** - Minimum 1280x720 recommended

Once all screenshots are saved in this folder:
1. Verify all 6 files are present with correct filenames
